 Enhancements and bugfixes for WinCC OA.


Prerequisites:
==============

 Besides the prerequisites of the final version of WinCC OA 3.17, no additional
 prerequisites are necessary.

 If WinCC OA 3.17 is already installed, a reinstall is automatically done.
 During the reinstallation the files of the existing WinCC OA 3.17 installation
 will be deleted.

 If WinCC OA 3.17 is not already installed it is not necessary to install the
 final version beforehand.
  
 
General installation notes:
===========================

 To install a patch properly complete following steps:

 - Download the required RPM (.rpm) files.
 - Copy the .rpm files to the plant.
 - Stop the project properly.

 - Within a terminal login as user "root".
 - Change to the subdirectory containing the downloaded RPMs.
 - To install this updated version of WinCC OA 3.17 simply use the following
   command:
    SLES/OpenSuse: "zypper install *.rpm"
    RedHat/CentOS: "yum install *.rpm"

 - Perform additional installation steps if required and described
   in the ReadMe files.
 - Start the project or the specific processes.


Additional installation steps:
==============================

 If P010 was not installed before and RDB is used please run
 WinCC_OA_Home\data\RDBSetup\ora\win_upgrade 8.22 or
 unix_upgrade 8.22 to apply latest changes to the DBSchema.

 Before stopping the project and starting the patch installation, you
 have to ensure that all RDB buffer files (WinCC OA Project/db/buffer)
 are processed and data is written to the Oracle database.


 If P009 was not installed before and NGA is used:
 
 If NGA is used and the startup sequence of NGA was changed after
 installation of P007, please make sure the startup sequence is set
 so that NGA is started _before_ the EVENT manager.


 If P007 was not installed before and NGA is used:

 Note that there are still open issues with NGA redundancy
 (synchronisation after restart of a redundant node is possibly not working
 correctly and user interface for redundancy configuration is being
 reworked).


Enhancements and new features:
==============================

 86552: The OPC UA Server allows the mapping of an alert class to an
        OPC UA alarm severity.

        Further details can be found inside the WinCC OA
        documentation.

 86553: The OPC UA Server is able to log session connect/disconnect
        attempts and values written by clients on an internal DPE now.

        Further details can be found inside the WinCC OA
        documentation.

 86554: The OPC UA Server can use the information of the _pv_range
        config for a value range check of write requests now.

        Further details can be found inside the WinCC OA
        documentation.

 86555: The OPC UA Server supports methods now.

        For detailed information including documentation please take a
        look the CTRL Library opcuaSrv_Methods.ctl.

 86556: The OPC UA Server allows the mapping of user bits to a specific
        OPC UA status code.

        Further details can be found inside the WinCC OA
        documentation.

 113574: The Russian version of the documentation chapters "Getting
         Started", "System Management - Communication" and "System
         Management - Permissions" have been revised and updated.

 117506: There is a new config entry for the OPC UA driver which allows
         to write values containing the source/server timestamp:
         [opcua] timestampWriteMode

         Further details can be found inside the WinCC OA
         documentation.

 121393: The config entry "userByteCommandMode "for IEC61850 Client can
         be set now for each driver instance individually.

 121666: TLS-Gateway supports receiving and sending of texts via FG4
         type 55 telegram now.
         Therefore, the following elements were added to the internal
         TLS FG4 data point type:

         - "_TLS_FG4.Parameter.DefaultText"
         - "_TLS_FG4.Zustand.AnzeigeText"
         - "_TLS_FG4.Zustand.TextAnforderung"
         - "_TLS_FG4.UZ.Befehl.AnzeigeText"
         - "_TLS_FG4.UZ.Befehl.DefaultText"

         If the TLS-Gateway is used, the DP list
         "TLSGateway_DpTypes.dpl" must be imported again with the
         ASCII manager using the option "Automatically update existing
         DP types" in order to update the internal TLS data point
         type.

 118685: There is a new config entry available for NGA:

         [NextGenArch] useOriginalValue

         Further details can be found inside the WinCC OA
         documentation.

         which allows to detect from a remote system if NGA is used.

         Further details can be found inside the WinCC OA
         documentation.

 118687: alertGetPeriod() can now be used for direct-read with NGA.
